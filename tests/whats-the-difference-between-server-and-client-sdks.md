The difference between Server and Client SDKs in Appwrite primarily lies in their intended use cases and the environments in which they operate.

### Client SDKs
Client SDKs are designed to be used in client-side applications, such as mobile apps or web applications. These SDKs are intended to run on the end-user's device and are typically used for operations that involve user interaction. They are optimized for security and performance in a client environment.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Environment:** Runs on the user's device (e.g., mobile app, web browser).
- **Security:** Includes mechanisms to handle authentication and authorization securely on the client side.
- **Use Cases:** User authentication, querying databases, file uploads, and other operations that require direct user input.

### Server SDKs
Server SDKs are designed to be used in server-side applications. These SDKs are intended to run on your server and are typically used for backend operations that do not involve direct user interaction. They are optimized for performance and security in a server environment.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Environment:** Runs on a server (e.g., Node.js server, backend service).
- **Security:** Allows for more control over security and access permissions, suitable for backend operations.
- **Use Cases:** Managing databases, handling file storage, performing scheduled tasks, and other backend operations.

### Example Code

#### Client SDK Example (JavaScript for Web)
```javascript
import { Client, Databases } from 'appwrite';

const client = new Client();

client
    .setEndpoint('https://[HOSTNAME_OR_IP]/v1') // Your API Endpoint
    .setProject('projectID'); // Your project ID

const databases = new Databases(client);

// Example: Fetching a list of documents
databases.listDocuments('collectionID')
    .then(response => {
        console.log(response);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error(error);
    });
```

#### Server SDK Example (Node.js)
```javascript
const { Client, Databases } = require('appwrite');

const client = new Client();

client
    .setEndpoint('https://[HOSTNAME_OR_IP]/v1') // Your API Endpoint
    .setProject('projectID') // Your project ID
    .setKey('API_KEY'); // Your secret API key

const databases = new Databases(client);

// Example: Fetching a list of documents
databases.listDocuments('collectionID')
    .then(response => {
        console.log(response);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error(error);
    });
```

In summary, Client SDKs are for client-side applications and are optimized for secure interactions with the end-user, while Server SDKs are for server-side applications and offer more control over backend operations.
