The Server SDKs are used for integrating with Appwrite to build server-side integrations or use inside your Appwrite Functions. They allow you to interact with the Appwrite API and perform various operations on the server-side. On the other hand, the Client SDKs are used for integrating with Appwrite on the client-side, such as in a web or mobile application. They provide a convenient way to interact with the Appwrite API from the client-side code. The Server SDKs are typically used for server-side logic and handling sensitive operations, while the Client SDKs are used for client-side interactions and user-facing functionality.
