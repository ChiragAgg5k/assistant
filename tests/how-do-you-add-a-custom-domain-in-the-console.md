To add a custom domain in the Appwrite Console, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Appwrite Console and navigate to your project.
2. Click on the **Settings** tab in the left sidebar.
3. Select the **Custom domains** section and click **Create domain**.
4. Add your domain, and copy the associated CNAME record to your DNS provider.
5. Verify your domain. Please note that DNS changes might take up to 48 hours to propagate worldwide.
6. Once your domain is verified, you can generate an SSL certificate.

After completing these steps, your Appwrite project will accept API requests from your custom domain.

If you encounter any issues during the setup process or have questions, feel free to [contact us](https://appwrite.io/docs/advanced/platform/custom-domains/#/contact-us) for assistance.
